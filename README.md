## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

This challenge is great for total newbies in order to get their hands on CSS and become more familiar with it. It helped me practice my design skills, mainly because it's been a few years since I stopped.


### Continued development

I'm gonna be doing more React projects, just to feel more comfortable with its tools. Hence why I'm going to be using react in most of my incoming projects.
